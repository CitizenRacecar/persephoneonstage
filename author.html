<p>
	David Hoffman is a composer and playwright living and working in Brooklyn, NY. He is committed to reinvigorating the art of American musical theater.</p>
<p>
	Son of a theatrical administrator and a freelance writer and designer, David began composing music as a child, studying piano from the age of 4, and guitar from 13. He began a serious study of percussion in High School, and also began to attract notice for his compositions, writing the music and lyrics for <em>Community of Hope</em>, a one-act musical about the history of the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, DC, which was commissioned by the DC Chamber of Commerce and premiered at the National Zoo.</p>
<p>
	David then attended Shenandoah University and the University of Maryland, concentrating in Theory, Percussion and Jazz Studies. While at Shenandoah his Trio for Winds was premiered by the Capital Wind Quintet. After leaving Shenandoah to pursue performing and teaching opportunities as a jazz, pop and show band drummer (including a brief stint on Carnival Cruise Lines), he transferred to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he released his first self-produced pop records <em>Clarity</em> and <em>The Runway</em>, and wrote the soundtracks for the independent feature film <em>Little White Boy</em>, which won the audience award at the 2002 Dahlonega International Film Festival (now called the Rome International Film Festival), and the independent short <em>Dream House</em>. He graduated, Cum Laude, in 2002.</p>
<p>
	After college, David composed the music and lyrics for two full-length theater pieces &ndash; <em>Juliet and Romeo: The Fatal Tour</em>, an excerpt of which was performed at the Folger Shakespeare Library, and <em>Patent Pending</em>, which received a workshop performance at Silver Spring Stage in Montgomery County, Maryland. He has also released two more pop albums, <em>The Rise and Fall</em> and <em>Smash Hit</em>, and a limited-edition EP, <em>Six More Songs about Women</em>, and has performed in New York City as a solo artist and with his band The Damn Fines.</p>
<p>
	David is also a visual artist. His paintings in oil have won awards, including a Scholastic Gold Key, and hang in numerous galleries and private collections.</p>
<p>
	He lives in Brooklyn with his wife, Kiryn.</p>
